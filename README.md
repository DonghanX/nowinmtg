Now in MTG
===========
![screenshots_nowinmtg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6f05159-b8de-4fd2-90e1-d7804e3ad8da)

**Now in MTG is an offline-first Android app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.**


## Arthitecture
The **Now in MTG** app is structured in the recommended Modern APP Architecture, following [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

## Modularization
The **Now in MTG** app adapts the modularization strategies to better organize the project, allowing it to scale as new features are added. For more information, Check out the [Google's android app modularization guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization).

To maintain dependencies in a scalable way, this app utilizes Gradle version catalogs ([Google's version catalogs migration guidance](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs)) to manage the versions of dependencies and plugins, and organizes the multi-modules builds into reusable Gradle conventions plugins ([Share build logic between subprojects - Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_convention_plugins.html)).
